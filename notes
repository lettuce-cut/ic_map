The below is the order of files to run if you change anythign in any of the below files:

- Run "python3 main.py allMovies.csv" in the command line
- This will output allMovies.csvoutput.csv
- Convert allMovies.csvoutput.csv to a json file (I normally just use https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm because I didn't want to make another program...)
- Download that json file and rename it to ABC.json
- in the ABC json, make sure EVERYTHING is inside { "movies": [ENTIRE ABC.json ORIGINAL FILE HERE]}
- Run "python3 alphabetize.py" in command line
- This will output an output.json
- In output.json to a find for \}\{ and replace with },\n{
- The entire file should be in a single pair of []
- Copy this output.json and move to from_geospatial folder. Delete movies2.json that's already there and rename output.json as movies2.json
